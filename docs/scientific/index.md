Scientific palettes are made by
[Fabio Crameri](http://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps.php).
All Scientific palettes are available with up to 256 discreetly defined colors.
They come in two sub-modules grouped by their use:

- [`palettable.scientific.diverging`][diverging]
- [`palettable.scientific.sequential`][sequential]
- [`palettable.scientific.qualitative`][qualitative]
